#Reflective Report
- This program is a brief and primitive program
designed to replicate the functionality of the Track and Trace
system.

- The user should be able to input their
details and the details of an event or establishment
to be later retrieved in the case of a 
coronavirus case found at the 
location.

- Before beginning this assignment it did seem daunting.
The specification makes the program a lot clearer though, since each 
section is laid out very clearly, and the instructions are 
fairly easy to implement into code.

- Having some previous experience in Java helped a lot
in that I didn't have to constantly
look up methods and things. 

- However, I did spend a lot of time
on debugging, and I feel like the code I have
produced is quite messy and resembles spaghetti.

- I spent a lot of time on little errors,
such as forgetting to print the return value of the filters,
then wondering why nothing was coming out!

- To remedy this, I probably could have written
pseudocode and laid out all the requirements for 
the assignment.

- I also did not pull my project directly from NUcode
and created it myself, so I may have missed something
important...
